# Assignment 5: Data-Driven Web Page

Throughout the semester we have been discussing key concepts needed to build web pages. In the last Techshop, you debugged and studied a data-driven web page that pulled data from a Google Sheet JSON feed. Working from that foundation, create your own simple data-driven webpage.

# Objective

Create and publish a data-driven webpage that pulls data from a Google Sheet.

::: If you are very comfortable working with Javascript you may use a data API of your choice instead of Google Sheets. If you choose to do so, please consult with me first and be prepared to fallback to Google Sheets if needed.

# Contstraints

- Build this page by hand with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- The primary content of your page should be data-driven.

# Tips

- This is a very open assignment with a lot of room for you decide what you want to focus on.
- Use this project as an opportunity to **play** and make something **you want** to make.
- This project is an opportunity to apply what you have learned about web development. This will improve your understanding if you **start small** and take the time to fully understand what you make.

# Deliverables

- Your final, hosted data-driven page.
- A case study for this project on your portfolio.
- Links to the page and the case study on the assignment matrix.

# Why are we doing this Assignment?
