### Systems Lab Assignments

I have tried to keep my assignment prompts short, with a focus on contraints rather than deliverables. Without many specifics, you had to figure out what to do for yourself. Figuring out what to do is often the most critical part of the design process.

If you don't understand things the end the assignment wasn't productive.
If you do understaing things at beginning the assignment wasn't challenging.
Ideally you shouldn't understand things at the beginning, but should at the end.


Brief Prompts, you need to fill in.
    Designer voice and values
    Clients don't know what the need.
