## 2D Study Science Fair

### Open Fair
*10 Minutes*

Look at the work created by the class.

### Opening Coversation
*25 Minutes*

Choose 1 or 2 studies. Practice describing the works *form*, *meaning*, and *purpose*.

#### Describe the Study's *form*.

Form is what the art *is*.

- What mediums and materials are used?
- What is the size and shape?
- What colors, textures, and forms are present?
- What types/styles of images are used?
- What types/styles of fonts are used?
- What is represented visually?*
- What is represented in text?*
- What does the work depict?*

#### Describe the Study's *meaning*.

Meaning is what the art *says*. 

- What is represented visually?*
- What is represented in text?*
- What does the work depict?* 
- How does the style relate to the content? 
- How do you interpret the meaning of the piece?
- What does the study make you think about?

#### Describe the Study's *purpose*.

Art are created for many purposes—to pursuade, inform, inspire, entertain, engage, support, celebrate, and honor. What do you think the designers intended purpose is? 

- What is the primary purpose of the piece?
- What is the audience of the piece?
- What is the impact or effect of the piece?
