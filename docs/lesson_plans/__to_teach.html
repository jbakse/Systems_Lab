<h3 id="science-fair">Science Fair</h3>
<h3 id="design-responsibility">Design Responsibility</h3>
<p>Every aspect of a design has an impact on the whole. That impact is not corelated with the effort spent by the designer.
As a designer you are responsible for every aspect of the design. You can’t</p>
<p>Gestalt</p>
<p>You can’t avoid communicating.
Each design decision <em>you make</em> communicates.
Each design decision <em>you don’t make</em> communicates also.</p>

<h3 id="systems-lab-assignments">Systems Lab Assignments</h3>
<p>I have tried to keep my assignment prompts short, with a focus on contraints rather than deliverables. Without many specifics, you had to figure out what to do for yourself. Figuring out what to do is often the most critical part of the design process.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand things the end the assignment wasn’t productive.
If you do understaing things at beginning the assignment wasn’t challenging.
Ideally you shouldn’t understand things at the beginning, but should at the end.</p>
<p>Brief Prompts, you need to fill in.
Designer voice and values
Clients don’t know what the need.</p>
