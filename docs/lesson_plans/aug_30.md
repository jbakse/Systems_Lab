## Charles and Ray Eames + Design Q+A

### Who Charles and Ray Are

> Charles Ormond Eames, Jr (1907–1978) and Bernice Alexandra "Ray" Eames (1912–1988) were husband and wife American designers who made significant historical contributions to the development of modern architecture and furniture. Among their most well-known designs is the Eames Lounge Chair. They also worked in the fields of industrial and graphic design, fine art and film.

## Constraints

It is a mistake to think of constraints as limits on creativity. On the contrary well crafted constraints force designers to consider unusual, non-obvious solutions.

> Here is one of the few effective keys to the Design problem: the ability of the Designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. Constraints of price, of size, of strength, of balance, of surface, of time, and so forth. Each problem has its own peculiar list.{large}

### Artist-imposed Constraints
Many artists have use self-imposed constraints to force creative solutions.

## Constraints Workshop
Introduction and discussion of [5-in-5 assignment](../assignment_5in5.html).

### Instructor
Divide the class into pairs.

### Qualities of Productive Constraints
*Class, 5 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm qualities of productive constraints.

For example: *Encourages Variety*


### Attributes of Artwork
*Class, 5 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm attributes of artworks. These are things you might mention when describing an artwork to someone.

For example: *Size*

### Sources of Outside Influence
*Class, 5 minutes*

As a class, brainstorm sources of outside influence, urgency, or chance. These should be easily accessible, but unpredictable outside resources that can provide a dynamic input into your creative process.

For example: *Newspaper Headlines*

### Draft, Round 1
*Individual, 5 minutes*

Write 2 constraints using the following method, these **will not be** the constraints that you will use for 5-in-5.

- Choose 2 items that appear in different lists (e.g. 1 Quality + 1 Source or 1 Source and 1 Attribute)
- Write a constraint that relates to those two items.
- Choose 2 more items that appear in different lists.
- Write a second constraint that relates to those two items.

For example: *Encourages Variety* + *Size* -> "1mm, 1cm, 1dm, 1m, dam"

### Share
*Groups, 5 minutes*

Read and explain your constraints to your partner in 1 minute. Your partner should not respond. Can easily explain it? If not, your constraint is not clear enough.

### Share
*Class, 10 minutes*

Read your best constraint to the class.

### Draft, Round 2
*Individual, 6 minutes*

Write 2 constraints, these **will be** the constraints that you will use for 5-in-5.

### Edit
*Groups, 6 minutes*

Partners review and edit their constraints.

### Review
*Class, 5 minutes*

What design verbs did we employ in crafting constraints?

## HTML+CSS Workshop, Part 1

We are going to run through a HTML+CSS Basics crash-course in the first few weeks of this class. Normally, I run this as a full-day intensive workshop but we don't have a full day. We'll take a few weeks to get through this, and in the mean time you'll be posting and building out web assignments. This will be a bit messy, but *messy is good* for learning.
