<h2 id="what-we-do-in-here">What We Do In Here</h2>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>Design is a methodical method of problem solving. It is a set of tools for identifying and understanding problems; proposing and testing solutions; and arriving—reliably—with an <strong>expression</strong> of <strong>purpose</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Design is the principle skill of the design technologist</strong>, and can be applied to challenges in all fields.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>A technology is anything we create that extends our human capability.</p>
<p>Roads allow us to travel faster and farther. Language allows us to share our ideas faster and farther. Computing allows us to think faster and farther.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a convenience or shortcut. Computation is the most important technology yet developed. Computation allows us to travel to new territories of thoughts, explore higher complexities, and reach ideas that before would have been out of reach.</p>
<p><strong>Computation is a principle media of the design technologist</strong>, and can be applied to challenges in all fields.</p>
<h3 id="important">Important</h3>
<p>Technologies are not neutral. Design is not neutral. The technologies we have access to and the way they are designed has an defining impact on how we approach problems, what we create, and how we lead our lives. Design Technologists use the skills and tools of design to play a critical role in guiding the impact technology has on our lives and our world. Technology is in great need of this guidance. Technology is too important and too powerful to let happen without design.</p>
<p>As the designers of technology we have a responsibility to consider the impact of our work broadly and to design according to our values:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the biases in the technologies we create?</li>
<li>What approaches do they encourage?</li>
<li>What solutions do they suggest?</li>
<li>What is the impact we want and what should we make to achieve that impact?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="externalities">Externalities</h3>
<p>Too often designer’s focus solely on understanding the features of a problem and evaluate a solution on how it impacts those features. <strong>It is critical to also consider the broader impacts—the externalities—of solutions.</strong></p>
<p>What are the costs and benefits created by a solution outside the features of the specific problem addressed?</p>
<h2 id="what-youll-do-out-there">What You’ll Do Out There</h2>
<p><strong>To be honest, I don’t know what you’ll do out there.</strong></p>
<p>Some of our graduates go to work at big tech or game companies, but more don’t. Our graduates bring their design skills and critical understanding of technology with them into a wide range of fields and industries. I hope they help shape how those fields and industries adopt and use emerging technologies.</p>
<p>I beleive the skill you will build in this program will prepare you well for the sometimes difficult job market you will be entering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand for true technical literacy is strong, and will stay strong as computation continues to drive growth and change across industries.</li>
<li>Strong creative and design skills resist outsourcing pressures. It is difficult to “design at a distance”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-to-program">Learning to Program</h2>
<p><strong>Learning to program is not the point, but it is essential.</strong></p>
<p>Programming is skill needed to design with computation, the most powerful technology.</p>

<p>Becoming proficient with code will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empower you to explore otherwise unreachable ideas.</li>
<li>Allow you to build your work now.</li>
<li>Allow you to build your work in the future.</li>
<li>Make you better team member.</li>
<li>Make you more employable.</li>
<li>Earn you more money.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not want to be a “coder” but you should want to be a “+coder”.
You may not want to be a “writer”, but you should want to be “+writer”.
In this field, coding and writing are basic literacy.</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>Jean Piaget was a psychologist that developed the theory of Constructivism: learning is an active process of reconstructing knowledge, rather than a transfer of knowledge.</p>
<p>Seymour Papert build on this theroy and developed Contructionism: learning is a student-centered process rooted in experience, best supported through project-based methods in an evironment rich in different models.</p>
<p>I strongly beleive in Constructivism and Constructionism.</p>
<pre><code>|--Teaching--|------------------------------------------------Learning------------------------------------|
</code></pre>
<p>I believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teachers cannot transfer knowlege or understanding to students.</li>
<li>Rather than providing answers, teachers should be guiding students to the correct questions.</li>
<li>You must build the answers yourself to reach understanding.</li>
<li>I don’t mean that facts are subjective or personal, but the way we understand them is.</li>
</ul>
