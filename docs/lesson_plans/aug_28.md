## August 28 {plain}

Many projects start with a good idea and end in a double-all-nighter with little work done in-between. Working this way can be fun and exciting when it leads to good results. It can also be stressful when things go wrong, frustrating when things fall apart, or tedious when you loose faith in the idea but must slog on anyway. Working this way makes it hard to guess which projects will work out and which won't and hard to steer a project that is veering of course.

This way of working sometimes leads to good results, especially on smaller projects where luck and raw, undisciplined talent is enough to scrape by. And after early success with this working this way, it can be frustrating to switch to a more methodical process-oriented design approach. Process-oriented design can feel mechanical and formulaic. It can feel like you are setting your talent, creativity, and good-ideas aside. It will probably feel like your project would be better if you went back to a good-idea-andâ€“double-all-nighter approach. In truth, that may even be true, at first. In time, through practice, your ability to use process-oriented design methods as tools will improve and they will begin to support your talents and allow you to create larger, more complicated projects with better results. When you have developed a personal process-oriented approach to design, you will have a set of tools needed to reliably produce successful projects.
