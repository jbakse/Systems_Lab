<h2 id="character-rolling">Character Rolling</h2>
<p>Lets start with a character. To speed this up, we will adapt some ideas D&amp;D and the <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Background_Design_(5e_Guideline)">DandDwiki.com Background Design Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="invention">Invention</h2>
<p>Look seven years forward to the year 2025. New developments in technology have shaped the world, but nothing radical has changed. The next seven years havn’t brought much more change the last seven.</p>
<h3 id="optimism-vs-pessimism">Optimism vs Pessimism</h3>
<h3 id="hope-vs-fear">Hope vs Fear</h3>
<h3 id="odd-vs-expected">Odd vs Expected</h3>
<h3 id="specific-vs-general">Specific vs General</h3>
<p>Consider your emerging technologies. What changes has this technology led to? What tools have been invented? What has moved from research labs to living rooms? How have people adopted the technology? What is possible now that was imposible before?</p>
<p>Consider the nature and goals of your character? How has this technology impacted his life?</p>
<h3 id="invent-something">Invent Something</h3>
<p>Come up with an invention that your character will both need and have access to by the year 2025.</p>
<p>What is the invention?
What does it do?
What is it for?
How big is it?
How much does it cost?
<strong>How will the character use it to achieve their short-term goal?</strong>
Draw a picture of it. Label its parts.
What else is important about the invention?</p>
<h2 id="story-telling">Story Telling</h2>
<p>At this point we have a lot of the key parts of a story: a setting, a character, a problem, and a partial solution. To tell the story, we need to bring these elements together in a plot.</p>
<p>Storyies need a beginning, a middle, and an end.</p>
<h3 id="beginning-exposition">Beginning: Exposition</h3>
<p>Introduce the world and the key the characters, relationships, and motivations.</p>
<h3 id="conflict">Conflict</h3>
<p>The conflict is the main question of the plot. Will the hero defeat the villian? Will the treasure hunter find the treasure?</p>
<p>The introduction marks the transition from the beginning to middle.</p>
<h3 id="middle-rising-action">Middle: Rising Action</h3>
<p>Show the actions taken by the hero to prevail in the conflict. Explain the challenges and setbacks the hero encounters. Show the stakes of success or failure.</p>
<h3 id="climax">Climax</h3>
<p>The climax resolves the conflict, answering the main question of the plot. The hero defeats the villian. The treasure hunter finds the treasure.</p>
<p>The climax marks the transition from the middle to the end.</p>
<h3 id="end-denouement">End: Denouement</h3>
<p>Wrap up the story. Resovle outstanding questions. Reveal secrets. Show what has changed.</p>
<h3 id="questions-2">Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who is your hero?</li>
<li>What is their goal?</li>
<li>What actions do they take?</li>
<li>Do they succeed?</li>
<li>What changed?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="telling-a-story-vs-telling-about-a-story">Telling a Story vs Telling About a Story</h3>
<p>Telling someone a story is very different than telling someone about a story. Telling someone a story is direct: you recount the action of the story as things that happened in the story’s world. Telling someone about a story is indirect: you explain the actions as things that happen in the story.</p>
<p>When you are telling a story, be careful not to slip into telling about a story.</p>
<h3 id="tell-the-story">Tell the Story</h3>
<p>Write your story in three short (1-3 scentences) paragraphs: beginning, middle, end.</p>
<h2 id="share-your-story">Share Your Story</h2>
<ol start="0">
<li>No introduction.</li>
<li>Read your story.</li>
<li>Tell us about your invention, and show your drawing.</li>
</ol>
