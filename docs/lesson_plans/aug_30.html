<p>You will often encounter very open problems, assignments, and briefs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-initiated research</li>
<li>Grant Requests for Proposals (RFPs)</li>
<li>Clients often don’t know what they need.</li>
<li>Clients often think they need something they don’t.</li>
<li>Product and business development</li>
<li>Your Thesis</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="systems-lab-assignments">Systems Lab Assignments</h3>
<p>I have tried to keep my assignment prompts short, with a focus on contraints rather than deliverables. Without many specifics, you had to figure out what to do for yourself. Figuring out what to do is often the most critical part of the design process.</p>
<h3 id="self-similar-design-process">Self-Similar Design Process</h3>
<p>The 2D phase of this assignment was much more open than the research phase.</p>
<p>Designing is largely about creating solutions to problems.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to do is a problem. Use design to create a solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you start with?</li>
<li>How did you decide what to do?</li>
<li>Did you use any of the tools or methods that we’ve discussed in class?</li>
<li><strong>Did you do any primary or secondary research?</strong></li>
<li>What other tools and methods did you use?</li>
<li>Do you have a personal process for getting started?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fractal Nature of Design Process</p>
<p>If you don’t understand things the end the assignment wasn’t productive.
If you do understaing things at beginning the assignment wasn’t challenging.
Ideally you shouldn’t understand things at the beginning, but should at the end.</p>
<p>Brief Prompts, you need to fill in.
Designer voice and values
Clients don’t know what the need.</p>
