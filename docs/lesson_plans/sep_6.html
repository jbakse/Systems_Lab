<h2 id="primary-research-vs-secondary-research">Primary Research vs Secondary Research</h2>
<p>Research is a critical part of the design process. One could describe design as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X">balancing competing goals and constraints</a>. Research is the process of discovering, understanding, developing, and forming those goals and constraints.</p>
<p>Designers make heavy use of both primary and secondary research throughout the design process, from ideation to delivery.</p>

<p>Secondary research is an important tool for designers:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is common for questions to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.</li>
<li>Ideas for creative projects often emerge from insights gleaned from research.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>My project is about X. What is X?</li>
<li>Is there anything interesting to say about X?</li>
<li>What do I think about X?</li>
<li>What do other people think about X?</li>
<li>Has anyone done work about X before?</li>
<li>Will people understand what I’m doing?</li>
<li>Does anyone actually want this?</li>
</ul>

<p>Research is an <em>necessary tool</em> for designers who wish to make designs founded on <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<h3 id="primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources">Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources</h3>
<p>Secondary research is collecting and learning from the research of others. There are three main types of sources to consult in secondary research.</p>

<p>Today is just practice to introduce these tools, you should use these tools as you work through this—and every—project.</p>
<p><strong>These are tools, not steps.</strong></p>
</div>
<h3 id="tool-1-concept-mapping">Tool 1: Concept Mapping</h3>
<p>In the beginning states of rearch, it is common for researches to shift and narrow their topic as they begin to understand the underlying issues better and find what interests them most.</p>
<p>Concept mapping can be used to explore a constellation of ideas and look for <strong>specific, interesting, researchable relationships</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, a researcher studying “self-driving cars” may find that their core interest is actually “how designers make life-and-death decisions”. They would then shift their research efforts in that direction, keeping “self-driving cars” as a key example.</p>
<div id="" class="callout">
<p><em>Individual, 10 minutes</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with a clean sheet of paper.</li>
<li>Choose a topic you are interested in developing a project around.</li>
<li>Write down your topic and the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.</li>
<li>Brainstorm concepts suggested by each bubble, adding them to your map.</li>
<li>Let your map grow in a freeform way. Don’t worry about how your map “should” look.</li>
<li>Connect related concepts. Look for interesting <strong>overlaps</strong>, <strong>contrasts</strong>, and <strong>tensions</strong>; mark them on your map.</li>
<li>Write down research topics suggested by these relationships.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="tool-2-topic-scoping">Tool 2: Topic Scoping</h3>
<p>It is important to consider the scope of your research topic early. Inexperienced researches tend to pick overly broad research topics.</p>
<p><strong>Broad</strong> topics are easier to find sources for, harder to cover, and <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Focused</strong> topics are harder to find sources for, easier to cover, and <strong>interesting</strong>.</p>
<table class="table table-responsive">

<h3 id="tool-3-a-research-statement">Tool 3: A Research Statement</h3>
<p>In research, “Why am I researching?”, “What am I researching?”, and “What do I need to learn?” are related but distinct questions. Composing a research statement can help you clarify the relationship between these three questions and help you answer them.</p>
<p>Creating a well written research statement will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify what you are researching and why.</li>
<li>Quickly communicate the scope and purpose of your research to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following template is a helpful guide for forming an effective research statement.</p>

<h2 id="presenting-your-findings">Presenting your Findings</h2>
<p>You will present your findings with a 4 minute slide presentation.</p>
<h3 id="0-plan">0. Plan</h3>
<p>Presenting in a short time requires planning and practice. Take the time to identify the most important information and rehearse to make sure you have time to present everything you plan to.</p>
<p>Almost all of your information should be conveyed by what you say, use slides sparingly to support what you say.</p>
<p>Don’t put any text on your slides you don’t expect us to read. Make sure you give us enough quiet time to read it.</p>
<h3 id="1-hook-em">1. Hook 'em</h3>
<p>Before you get to the primary point, give us a reason to be interested.</p>
<p>A personal, relatable anecdote or a specific, thought-provoking question is often an effective opener.</p>
<h3 id="2-tell-em-what-youll-tell-em">2. Tell 'em What You’ll Tell 'em</h3>
<p>Briefly tell us what your presentation is about, and what we will know at the end. This helps us organize the information in our heads as you deliver it. For this presentation, you might do this using the research statement template. In a presentation about your project, you might show your finished project first.</p>
<div id="" class="callout">
<p>Don’t wander up to your point. Start with the most interesting thing you learned through your research and then elaborate. Start with what you made, and then tell us about it.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="3-tell-em">3. Tell 'em</h3>
<p>Convey your research findings. Specifically connect everything you tell us to the larger context and your main point.</p>
<h3 id="4-tell-em-what-you-told-em">4. Tell 'em what you told 'em</h3>
<p>Bring your presentation to a clear conclusion.</p>
<div id="" class="callout">
<p>A good way to bring your project to a conclusion is a single, clear scentence that connects a key finding and a possible future action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The depiction of male sex appeal in K-Pop music videos is different from that in western music videos, and I’d like to explore what influences led to that difference in further research.</p>
