# Assignment 4: Case Study Portfolio

Great work won't get you much if no one knows about it. A decent designer that is great a self-promotion will do better than a great designer who sucks at it. Don't let your talent, skill, and effort go to waste; make sure people see what you do.

You should use this assignment to create a digital portfolio you are proud of. One that represents you and your work the way you want to represented and that you are eager to show to others. 
/::

### Objective

Create and publish unified portfolio that showcases both you and your work.

### Contstraints

- This should be one website hosted from one Github repo using github pages.
- Create a new repo and start from scratch.
- Your portfolio site should be created by hand using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Your portfolio should be unified: each page should share a common visual vocabulary and a common navigation should allow users to traverse the whole site.
- Your portfolio must contain case studies for *5 in 5*, *Ideas in Form*, *Instruction Sets*, and **at least one project created outside of Systems Lab.**
- Each case study should be presented on its own page.
- Each case study should be clear, interesting, organized, and well designed.
- Your portfolio should also contain a home page, and at least 2 other pages with content of your choosing.
- You must create a unique portfolio not shared with any of your team members from this semester. You may, however, include photographic or written documentation that you generated with your team.

### Tips

- Present your projects, not your assignments.
- Own this project. Your goal shouldn't be to complete this assignment, your goal should be to build a real web portfolio that you will use.
- Leave room for further case studies so your portfolio can grow as you complete future projects.

### Deliverables

- Your final, hosted web portfolio.
- Links to your final portfolio and WIP material on the assignment matrix.

### Why are we doing this Assignment?

- Critically reflect on the various projects completed so far.
- Practice designing and creating a website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Practice creating clear, interesting, organized communication.
- Provide you with an opportunity to focus specifically on building an online portfolio.
- As a design technologist you **absolutely need** to have an web presence to promote yourself and your work.
