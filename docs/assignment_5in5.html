<p>Sketches are artistic expressions not intended as finished works. Sketching serves many purposes and a practice of frequent sketching is extremely valuable to artists and designers.</p>
<div id="" class="callout">
<p>I have personally found <a href="http://jbakse.netdone.com/">1-A-Day</a> projects to be valuable ways of moving my studio practice forward.</p>
</div>
<p>In today’s class each of you will develop a small set of constraints to guide the conceptualization of daily sketches. Over the next week you will use these constraints as you complete a series of five sketches.</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>Create and document a body of sketches based on a set of constraints.</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<p>Each project must be conceptualized, produced, and documented in a single day.
Each project must follow the constraints you developed in class.</p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<p>Document your projects each day. Your documentation will likely include images (2-3 good photos) and a brief description (50-100 words), but other formats may fit your sketches better. Just generate and collect this material at this point; you will need it for class discussions and for next week’s assignment.</p>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t wait for a perfect idea. Work on the first idea that comes to mind each day.</li>
<li>Don’t skip any days. Don’t do multiple sketches in one day.</li>
<li>Adjust how you document your work based on its form. Is video or audio more appropriate than photography?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-are-we-doing-this-assignment">Why are we Doing this Assignment?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explore the relationship between constraints and creativity.</li>
<li>Explore the value of a daily sketching practice.</li>
<li>Develop and share your personal voice as designer and maker.</li>
<li>Create documentation material for a body of work for use in the next assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="assignment-1b-5-in-5-case-study">Assignment 1b: 5 in 5 Case Study</h1>
<p>Making good work is <strong>necessary but not sufficient</strong> for success as a designer. The ability to effectively and persuasively present your work is critical. Having completed <em>5 in 5</em>, you should have a small body of work to share. In this assignment you will build a page that presents the work you have just made.</p>
<h3 id="objective-2">Objective</h3>
<p>Effectively showcase the sketches you made for <em>5 in 5</em> and your personal motivation and process behind the project.</p>
<h3 id="constraints-2">Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your casestudy should be a single web page.</li>
<li>Your casestudy should include written and photographic documentation of all of your sketches.</li>
<li>Your casestudy should also explain the project as a whole.</li>
<li>Your casestudy should be clear, interesting, organized and well designed.</li>
<li>Create your webpage by hand using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
<li>Host your showcase using Github pages.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips-2">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Present the project, not the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deliverables-2">Deliverables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your final, hosted webpage.</li>
<li>A link to your page on the assignment matrix.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-are-we-doing-this-assignment-2">Why are we Doing this Assignment?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Begin and continue a practice of documenting and presenting your work publicly.</li>
<li>Critically reflect on the 5 in 5 assignment.</li>
<li>Develop skills for planning, designing, creating, and hosting web content.</li>
</ul>
