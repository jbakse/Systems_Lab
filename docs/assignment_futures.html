<p>Systems Lab has been primarily about using design as a method of inquiry and research. We have been using design for better understanding problems rather than suggesting solutions. This same approach can also be used to better understand our world and its future. In this assignment you will explore the potential cascading impact of an emerging technology through a series of short workshops and studies.</p>
<h1 id="part-1-systems-map-report">Part 1:  Systems Map + Report</h1>
<p><em>Due Tuesday, Nov 27</em></p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
