<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>The primary goal of Systems Lab is to present design as a method of inquiry with a focus on process-oriented design, design research methods, and creative studio practice.</p>
<p>The course is run in a studio format, with a primary focus on building and testing projects. Students will work individually and in groups to ideate, research, prototype, build, test, and document their projects. In addition to making, all students are also required to contribute to class discussion and critique to demonstrate their understanding and perspective on the subjects studied.</p>
<p>Primary themes include: using design to understand—rather than solve—problems; design constraints and rules; sketches, studies; prototypes; public engagement and user testing.</p>
<h3 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>Creative Technologies Systems is taught in two classes: a Studio that focuses on context, communication and critique, and a Lab that focuses on methodology, technology, and making. The primary learning objectives for each pillar are outlined below.</p>
<h4 id="key-lab-learning-outcomes">Key Lab Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p><strong>Methodology: Process-Oriented Design</strong></p>
<p>Learning Objective: Introduce and practice key design processes including primary and secondary research, sketching, design studies, prototyping, user-testing, and iteration.</p>
<p>Assessable Outcome: Employ these key design processes in a series of assignments and projects.</p>
<p><strong>Technology: Data APIs</strong></p>
<p>Learning Objective: Conceive and implement projects that incorporate networked data-sources.</p>
<p>Assessable Outcome: Recognize the affordances, possibilities, and constraints of APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Making: Web Portfolio</strong></p>
<p>Learning Objective: Bolster web-based coding skills and communication strategies in order to create an online portfolio that communicates a cohesive idea trajectory or set of projects.</p>
<p>Assessable Outcome: Create a compelling web-based portfolio that presents a set of DT projects for a specific audience.</p>
<h4 id="key-studio-learning-outcomes">Key Studio Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p><strong>Context: Audience-Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Learning Objective: Build understanding about how designs meet the needs, values, and goals of specific audiences.</p>
<p>Assessable Outcome: Students will conduct iterative user-testing and user needs assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Communication: Impact</strong></p>
<p>Learning Objective: Introduce tools to assess user needs and design propositions such as qualitative and quantitative research, ethnographic/demographic/participatory research, user surveys, user interviews, and user testing.</p>
<p>Assessable Outcome: Identify and use the right assessment tools to better understand the impact and effectiveness of their projects.</p>
<p><strong>Critique: Presentations</strong></p>
<p>Learning Objective: Practice and hone verbal presentation methods to communicate design intentions,processes, and outcomes.</p>
<p>Assessable Outcome: Demonstrate ability to clearly convey their design intentions, processes, and outcomes in the context of project presentations.</p>
<h3 id="primary-assignments">Primary Assignments</h3>
<h4 id="5-in-5">5 in 5</h4>
<p>Define a set of rules or constraints that will guide a series of small projects. Execute a creative project every day for five days based on these constraints.</p>
<h4 id="ideas-in-form">Ideas in Form</h4>
<p>Research a specific subject of interest. Create a series of projects exploring your subject in different media.</p>
<h4 id="instruction-sets-for-strangers">Instruction Sets for Strangers</h4>
<p>Analyze: Choose a space you find interesting. Research its history &amp; architecture. Observe its flows &amp; patterns for 24 hours. Document &amp; map your findings.</p>
<p>Define: Design a site-specific intervention you think would facilitate meaningful interaction. Research &amp; define it. Consider the ideas of invitation (how to get people involved) and triangulation (how to get people to interact with one another).</p>
<p>Test: Deploy your prototype in  the space. Observe and document the results.</p>
<h4 id="final-project">Final Project</h4>
<p>Students work individually to formulate a creative premise or question, use design to investigate their premise and ultimately arrive at a project based response. Students are encouraged to think about their own personal design process: what ideas interest them, how they research them, how they develop a personal premise (opinion) about them, and how they produce a creative work in response to their query.</p>
<h4 id="personal-site">Personal Site</h4>
<p>Students will post course work—including reading responses, writing assignments, project prototypes, work in progress, and final documentation—to their own website. This site will initially be built using hand-made HTML, CSS, and Javascript and hosted using Github pages.
Students who demonstrate an solid understanding of these technologies may switch to other technologies with instructor approval. At the end of the semester, students must complete a web-based portfolio.</p>
<!-- ### Course Outline
The following outlines the main topics to be presented in each class. This may be adjusted during the semester.

[[ Calendar ]] -->
<h2 id="assessable-tasks">Assessable Tasks</h2>
<p>The focus of this class is on design process not final results. Most of your grade will reflect your ability to apply process-oriented design to an domain of inquiry and clearly communicate your process and findings.</p>
<h3 id="grading-considerations">Grading Considerations</h3>
<h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
<p>How well is the student able to express their ideas, both verbally and with other forms of communication such as: writing, drawing, mapping, and documenting?</p>
<h4 id="critical-thinking-and-reflective-judgment">Critical Thinking and Reflective Judgment</h4>
<p>To what degree has the student demonstrated and developed critical thinking skills over the course of the semester? How well can the student apply these skills to producing and evaluating Design and Technology projects supported with research and evidence?</p>
<h4 id="design-process">Design Process</h4>
<p>How well does the student incorporate process-oriented design methods including sketching, brainstorming, researching, prototyping, user testing, and iteration. Can the student effectively develop and validate solutions to design problems.</p>
<h4 id="integration-and-appropriate-use-of-technology">Integration and Appropriate Use of Technology</h4>
<p>Are the students making good choices about the form and type of technology they are using to express their design concepts? Are the students able to integrate technology into the conceptualization of their projects?</p>
<h4 id="iteration-production-time-management">Iteration, Production, Time Management</h4>
<p>Are students able to scale their projects to the appropriate time frame and technical/design resources at their disposal? Are students recording their thoughts and processes on their website so that their knowledge can be shared with the rest of the class.</p>

<h3 id="resubmitting-and-making-up-work">Resubmitting and Making Up Work</h3>
<p>Because this class emphasizes process-oriented design and includes group assignments, I strongly discourage resubmitted or make-up assignments. Please make every effort to complete your assignments each week. If you anticipate difficulty for any reason, please speak with me immediately to make a plan.</p>
<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>Extra Credit will be given for formal contributions to the class. One way to contribute is to provide corrections, enhancements, or additions to the class materials and website. For example, spelling and grammar corrections submitted through a pull request will earn a small amount of credit. More credit can be earned by adding content to class notes or resource pages, authoring small tutorials that benefit the class, and other such contributions.</p>
<h2 id="class-policies">Class Policies</h2>
<h3 id="required-reading">Required Reading</h3>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course. Students will not need to purchase any readings for this class. Links to online articles will occasionally be provided.</p>
<h3 id="materials-and-supplies">Materials and Supplies</h3>
<p>Please bring your laptop, a notebook, a sketchbook, and black pen, a red pen, and a pencil to each class.</p>
<p>As this is a project based course, you may need to purchase various materials and supplies required to support your individual projects.</p>
<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>
<p>By appointment. Email to arrange. I will typically be available before and after class for quick questions and informal discussion.</p>
<h3 id="backups-and-github">Backups and Github</h3>
<p>Each student <strong>must</strong> keep backups of their digital work, including source code and images and be prepared to <strong>submit or re-submit</strong> this work at anytime. I strongly suggest that you host your work on Github to benefit from both versioning and backup. Data loss, regardless of fault—yours, mine, or a third party—will not be accepted as an excuse for missing work.</p>
<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>In short: <strong>Attend every class, get there early, stay late.</strong></p>
<p>This class meets twice a week and the pace will be fast. New material will be introduced each week and in-class workshops and discussions will be held in nearly every class. Missing even a single class will impact your participation in the class and you will be responsible for making up for that impact.</p>
<p><strong>If you miss three or more classes your final grade will most likely be reduced.</strong>
<strong>If you miss six or more classes you will most likely be asked to withdraw from the class.</strong></p>
<p>This includes absences from the first class due to late enrollment. Late arrivals or early departures may count as an absence. Inappropriate use of a laptop (e.g. browsing social media during critiques or lectures) may result in being marked as absent and will certainly impact your participation grade.</p>
<p>Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in this course syllabus.</p>
<p>While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</p>
<h3 id="laptops-devices">Laptops + Devices</h3>
<p>We will spend a good amount of class time working together on projects. During work time, computers will sometimes be used. However, during lectures, discussion, and critiques computers must be closed. Note-taking can be done on paper. Nothing kills a conversation like a room full of people staring at screens.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism-code-and-open-source">Plagiarism, Code, and Open-Source</h3>
<p>Code reuse is a complex issue in computer programming. Looking at existing code is a key part of the programming process, especially while learning. You often learn best by modifying working examples rather than starting from scratch. We stand on the shoulders of giants; that is a key part of the open-source philosophy.</p>
<p>However, copy+paste makes it easy to use other’s code without understanding it. It is important when using example code that you take the time to read, study, and understand it. In many cases this process can begin with simply retyping code instead of pasting it.</p>
<p>In a professional environment, the best practice is often to reuse existing code as much as possible. When learning however, it is often best to do as much as possible from scratch.</p>
<p>With that in mind, you may use limited amounts of existing code in your homework. However, there is a very important caveat: any code you use, borrow, and/or modify must be labeled as such. If you study code closely but do not directly use any of it, you should still cite the code you studied in your own source. <strong>Every time you use code, copy, or images you didn’t create, document your use in your source code with a comment.</strong> If your work uses someone else’s code, copy, or images in a substantial way you should also cite the work when you post your work. You must include the name of the author (even if it is me or a student in this class), the source URL if possible, and you must make clear which lines of code are not yours. If you fail to do this, you may fail the class. It is very, very easy to get this right: if you take a moment’s time to label your work correctly, you will not have a problem. Be diligent and honest.</p>
<h2 id="divisional-and-program-policies">Divisional and Program Policies</h2>
<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>
<p>The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University (and associated) Libraries: <a href="http://library.newschool.edu">http://library.newschool.edu</a></li>
<li>The University Learning Center: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center">http://www.newschool.edu/learning-center</a></li>
<li>University Disabilities Service: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services">http://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In keeping with the university’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.</p>
<h3 id="making-center">Making Center</h3>
<p>The Making Center is a constellation of shops, labs, and open workspaces that are situated across the New
School to help students express their ideas in a variety of materials and methods. We have resources to help
support woodworking, metalworking, ceramics and pottery work, photography and film, textiles, printmaking,
3D printing, manual and CNC machining, and more. A staff of technicians and student workers provide expertise
and maintain the different shops and labs. Safety is a primary concern, so each area has policies for access,
training, and etiquette that students and faculty should be familiar with. Many areas require specific
orientations or trainings before access is granted. Detailed information about the resources available, as well as
schedules, trainings, and policies can be found at <a href="http://resources.parsons.edu">resources.parsons.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of B or higher.</p>
<p>Grades of D are not used in graduate level courses.</p>
<h3 id="grade-of-w">Grade of W</h3>
<p>The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete.</p>
<h3 id="grade-of-z">Grade of Z</h3>
<p>The grade of Z is issued by an instructor to a student who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade.</p>
<h3 id="grades-of-incomplete">Grades of Incomplete</h3>
<p>The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations:</p>
<p><strong>Undergraduate students:</strong> Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “F” by the Registrar’s Office.</p>
<p><strong>Graduate students:</strong> Work must be completed no later than one year following the end of the class. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “WF” (for Parsons and Mannes graduate students) or “N” (for all other graduate students) by the Office of the Registrar. The grade of “N” does not affect the GPA but does indicate a permanent incomplete.</p>
<h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>
<p>Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.  Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.</p>
<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-2">Attendance</h3>
<p>Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly and in compliance with the standards stated in the course syllabus.</p>
<p>While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is generally defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Lateness or early departure from class may be recorded by the instructor as one full absence. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.</p>
<p>Whether the course is a lecture, seminar or studio, faculty will assess each student’s performance against all of the assessment criteria in determining the student’s final grade.</p>
<h3 id="canvas">Canvas</h3>
<p>Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week.</p>
<h3 id="delays">Delays</h3>
<p>In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class.  If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival.  In the event that I will miss class entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.</p>
<h3 id="electronic-devices">Electronic Devices</h3>
<p>The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course’s work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.</p>
<h3 id="academic-honesty-and-integrity">Academic Honesty and Integrity</h3>
<p>Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.</p>
<p>Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/policies/">http://www.newschool.edu/policies/</a> Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the Learning Center’s website: <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/student-resources/">http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/student-resources/</a></p>
<p>The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.</p>
