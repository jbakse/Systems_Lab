<p>Designers combine many methods of research to <em>both gather existing information</em> and <em>explore new ideas through making</em>. This assigment focuses on design studies—small, focused pieces created in the research phase of design projects. Designers use studies to look for interesting connections between formal elements (expression) and research topics (content).</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research a chosen topic and create a series of studies exploring that topic in different mediums.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and maintain a webpage documenting your process and results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="part-1-background-research">Part 1: Background Research</h1>
<p>In pairs, choose a narrow topic of shared interest to research. Present your topic to the class.</p>
<h3 id="10-minute-expert">10 Minute Expert</h3>
<ol>
<li>Identify 5 to 8 aspects of your research topic.</li>
<li>Find 2 to 3 high-quality web resources (articles, websites, videos) for each.</li>
<li>Write a 1 sentence overview describing <em>the value</em> of each resource.</li>
<li>Add an organized directory of links to your project page.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you may wish to <em>reframe</em> or <em>narrow</em> your research topic, but don’t <em>change</em> it.</p>
<h3 id="concept-mapping-topic-scoping-research-statement">Concept Mapping, Topic Scoping, Research Statement</h3>
<p>Use these tools to improve your research and planning. Include your concept map, topic scope list, and research statement on your project page.</p>
<h3 id="secondary-research">Secondary Research</h3>
<p>Explore the physical and online New School libraries.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find and study <strong>two secondary sources</strong>.</li>
<li>Find and study <strong>two primary sources</strong>.</li>
<li>For each of these write a ~100 word summary focusing on key information related to your research topic.</li>
<li>Add your summaries to your project page using the <a href="https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/DocChicago.html">Chicago</a> style for your individual citations.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you may wish to <em>reframe</em> or <em>narrow</em> your research topic, but don’t <em>change</em> it.</p>
