# Assignment 1a: 5 in 5

Sketches are artistic expressions not intended as finished works. Sketching serves many purposes and a practice of frequent sketching is extremely valuable to artists and designers. 

::: .callout
I have personally found [1-A-Day](http://jbakse.netdone.com/) projects to be valuable ways of moving my studio practice forward.
/::

In today’s class each of you will develop a small set of constraints to guide the conceptualization of daily sketches. Over the next week you will use these constraints as you complete a series of five sketches.

### Objective
Create and document a body of sketches based on a set of constraints.

### Constraints
Each project must be conceptualized, produced, and documented in a single day.
Each project must follow the constraints you developed in class.

### Deliverables
Document your projects each day. Your documentation will likely include images (2-3 good photos) and a brief description (50-100 words), but other formats may fit your sketches better. Just generate and collect this material at this point; you will need it for class discussions and for next week’s assignment.

### Tips
- Don’t wait for a perfect idea. Work on the first idea that comes to mind each day.
- Don’t skip any days. Don't do multiple sketches in one day.
- Adjust how you document your work based on its form. Is video or audio more appropriate than photography?

### Why are we Doing this Assignment?
- Explore the relationship between constraints and creativity.
- Explore the value of a daily sketching practice.
- Develop and share your personal voice as designer and maker.
- Create documentation material for a body of work for use in the next assignment.

# Assignment 1b: 5 in 5 Case Study

Making good work is **necessary but not sufficient** for success as a designer. The ability to effectively and persuasively present your work is critical. Having completed *5 in 5*, you should have a small body of work to share. In this assignment you will build a page that presents the work you have just made.

### Objective
Effectively showcase the sketches you made for *5 in 5* and your personal motivation and process behind the project.

### Constraints
- Your casestudy should be a single web page.
- Your casestudy should include written and photographic documentation of all of your sketches.
- Your casestudy should also explain the project as a whole.
- Your casestudy should be clear, interesting, organized and well designed.
- Create your webpage by hand using plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- Host your showcase using Github pages.

### Tips

- Present the project, not the assignment.

### Deliverables
- Your final, hosted webpage.
- A link to your page on the assignment matrix.

### Why are we Doing this Assignment?
- Begin and continue a practice of documenting and presenting your work publicly.
- Critically reflect on the 5 in 5 assignment.
- Develop skills for planning, designing, creating, and hosting web content.
