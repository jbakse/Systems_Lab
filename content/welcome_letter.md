# Hello Lizette + Josefina + Lillian + <br/> Keaton + Aleksandra + Alyssa + Dahee + Herbert + <br/> Brooke + Andy + Julia + Forrest!


Welcome to CT Systems Lab. I'm looking forward to meeting you all (and seeing some of you again).


## Bookmark this Site
The class website is http://systemslab.compform.net

**This site will host the class calendar, syllabus, assignments, and lecture notes.**

## You have Homework
The Studio Introduction assignment is described on the class website.

Be ready to present your introduction at the start of class. 

**This assignment is due at the beginning of the first class.**



## Read the Syllabus
The Syllabus is on the class website. Read it now!

**Bring three questions about the syllabus, typed on paper, to the first class.**

These will count toward your "participation" grade! 

This can be an easy "A" or easy "0" to kick off your semester.

## Be on Time
The short version of my attendance policy:

**Attend every class, arrive early, stay late.**


## Be Prepared
Bring these things to Tuesday's class and to every class:

**laptop + a sketchbook for this class + red pen + black pen + pencil + camera/phone**
