# Assignment 6: Emerging Futures

Systems Lab has been primarily about using design as a method of inquiry and research. We have been using design for better understanding problems rather than suggesting solutions. This same approach can also be used to better understand our world and its future. In this assignment you will explore the potential cascading impact of an emerging technology through a series of short workshops and studies.

# Part 1:  Systems Map + Report

*Due Tuesday, Nov 27*

### Objective

Research an assigned emerging technology, create a detailed systems map contextualizing your technology and its potential impact, and present your findings to the class.

### Systems Map Constraints

- Follow the mapping format used in the workshop.
- Your assigned technology should be near the center of your systems map.
- Your map should include **all** of "impact targets" listed below.
- Your map should include 50 to 60 interconnected entities.
- **Every** connection should use a verb and single or double arrow to explain the relationship.
- Use additional markings as you see fit to call out interesting features of your map.
- Your map should be nicely designed, printed or **very neatly** **hand drawn, and at least 24x24 inches.

### Presentation Constraints

- Your presentation should be exactly 4 minutes long.
- Specifically mention each of your primary and secondary sources by name and at least one finding from each.
- Your presentation should be supported by slides.
- Use exactly 8 slides.
- Prefer images to text on your slides.
- No more than 8 words on a slide.
- Describe your emerging technology.
- Choose and discuss an interesting "path" or "cluster" from your map. Detail each entity in the cluster and the relationships between them.

<!-- ### Technologies

### Impact Targets

Voting, Local Newspapers, Traffic Tickets, Small Claims Court, Kindergarten, Drinking Water, Daily Commutes, Apartments, Doctor Visits, Job Applications, Farmers Markets, Home Loans, Family Vacations, Conversations

### Tips

- Use specific verbs: "threatens" is better than "impacts"

### Deliverables

- Systems map
- In-class presentation

### Why Are We Doing This Assignment?

- Practice researching technologies, understanding them in context, and forecasting their potential impact.
- Develop critical approach to technologies.
- Practice multiple modes of communication.

# Part 2:  Predictive Product Pitch

*Due Tuesday, December 4*

### Objective

Imagine a product that your technology will enable in the next 5 to 10 years. Create materials to convey your idea in both an in-class presentation and your case study.

### Case Study Constraints

- Create a ~200 word written user scenario explaining your products general use.
- Create a storyboard explaining your products general use.
- Create a rendering showcasing your product.

### Presentation Contraint

- Present your product in 1-4 minutes.
- Be well prepared, well rehearsed, and interesting.

### Tips

- For your presentation: consider acting out the use of your product in a skit.
- Consider partnering up to support your in-class presentations.
- Consider building low-fidelity props to illustrate your product in the presentation.

### Deliverables

- User scenario, storyboard, and rendering.
- In-class presentation

### Why Are We Doing This Assignment?

- Practice designing for emerging technologies.
- Practice explaining ideas.


# Part 3: Secret


<!-- # Part 3:  Disaster Exhibit

*Due Tuesday, December 11*

### Objective

Imagine the worst possible outcome of your product gaining massive popularity. What disaster could your product lead to? Create a timeline from the introduction of your product to that disaster. Taking the role of a museum designer in 2038, create an exhibit to explain the events of your timeline.

### Deliverables

- A 12x12 inch or larger diorama of your exhibit
- A printed, 12x24 inch or larger timeline
- In class presentation.

### Why Are We Doing This Assignment?

- Develop critical approach to evaluating project proposals.
- Practice evaluating potential externalities of technology projects.
- Practice communicating about technology.
- Fun -->
