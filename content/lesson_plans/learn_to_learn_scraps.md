# You learn more from writing than reading.

Take notes in class. On paper. Add drawings. Use the space of the page. Go back and organize your notes, redrawing them as system maps, charts, timelines.

When reading, don’t take notes on what the text says. Add annotations to the text. Look up names and events that are nentiobed and add them. Write a quiz as you go. Review by following the quiz.

Don’t think I’d take hone wtitting assignments essays and responses as quizzes where you list what you know. They are an opportunity for you to organize and develop your understanding. “Elaboration”

# Recalling is the key to memorizing, not drilling.

# Teaching is a great way to learn.

Forces you to recognize gaps in your thinking. Einstein eli5

# Treat presentations like projects.

# The trick.

Learn to work on your projects not your assignments. Assignments are meant to launch you into a project you own. Etc.

# Document Everything

Document everything. Not just pictures and video. But write too. Keep a “private process blog. Write “public case studies for every project. Reflection!

# Front load your work.

Start on assignments right away. If you are going to pull an all-nighter, do it on day one.

Reasons. Time to ask questions order materials, fix problems. Think. Revise. Avoid rushes, get the most from support.

# This isn't moral.

This isn't a moral thing. If it were possible to transfer knowledge without active effort on the part of the learner I would encourage it.

# The People Who Make Things are the People Who Make Things

Artists are people who make art. If you make art you ARE an artist. If you don’t you ARE NOT.

# Beware of overloading

Taking extra credit, a job, internship or taking on research projects with your teachers can all be good sometimes. , but be very careful when deciding to take on extra responsibilities.

Be aware of the opportunity costs.  Make sure these activities online with your educational goals

One doing too much simply means you’re stretched too thin and he won’t have time to do a good job on the things you’re doing

To even if you can manage to do everything if you’re overbooked you have to start scheduling things by what’s the do next with the highest priority as this gets in the way of front loading

 You need to leave room to explore things on your own. When one of your projects leads to an idea that you want to explore more if you’re over booked we won’t be able to explore it and you’ll feel like you’re just trying to get everything done rather than enjoying learning

Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself. —John Dewey

Education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living. —John Dewey
