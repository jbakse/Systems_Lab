## Bodystorming
*60 minutes*

Bodystorming is a design idea development method that mixes improv, brainstorming, user-testing, and charades. In bodystorming designers discuss and propose ideas while acting those ideas out. This activiy encourages designers to think about the relationship between space—*size, distance, layout*—and users—*bodies, motives, actions*.

- Choose a **narrator** to facilitate the session. The narrator describes the action and can pause, slow, or rewind the action.
- Assign **acting** roles to the rest of the group. Consider how participants, spectators, and facilitators will interact.
- **Iterate** Run through multiple variations of the idea.
- **Avoid disagreement** Disagreements slow and stop discussions. It is much faster to let a "bad" idea play out and then move on to another iteration. Edit ideas later. Work in the spirit of "Yes, and.."
- **Use the space** Use tables and chairs as stand-ins. Draw on the whiteboards, pin things up. Ideally you should bodystorm in your intended environment.

## Phoneboarding
*30 minutes*

Create a "phoneboard" of your idea.
- A phoneboard is a method of rapidly creating a storyboard experience design using your phone to photograph people acting out each step of an interaction.
- Create a storyboard with 6 panels. Consider including frames showing the "invite", "engage", and "exit" stages of your experience.
- Annotate your panels with illustrated props, word balloons, and thought bubbles.
- Use caption to explain the action in each panel.
- Try to work quickly, and complete the phone board in class.
- If you don't complete the phone board in class, complete it as homework.
