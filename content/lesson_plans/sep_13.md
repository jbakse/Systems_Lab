1. Dahee + Andy
2. Lillian + Rui
3. Herbert + Alyssa

### Sketches + Studies + Prototypes

The design process usually involves the creation of many artifacts of different types: Studies, Sketches, Drafts, Surveys, Storyboards, Wireframes, Mockups, Renderings, User Stories, Treatments, Personas, Prototypes.

Each type of artifact supports the design process in different ways. In practice these terms have a lot of overlap and are often used i

#### Sketches
Sketches are created to explore formal ideas on their own.
- Sketches are very low-cost and ephemeral creative generators
- Sketches can be used to build understanding of tools and techniques 

#### Studies
Studies are created to explore the relationship between form, subject, and purpose.
- Studies reveal unexpected opportunities and insights
- Studies can develop an idea without the burden of completing it

#### Prototypes
Prototypes are created to test specific, proposed design ideas.
- A prototype tests one or more characteristics of a proposed design option.  
- A prototype directly embodies the characteristics being tested.

### 2D + 3D Studies
Introduce the 2D and 3D portion of the [Ideas in Form](../assignment_ideas.html) assignment.


| Deliverable               | Recommended Time |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 2D Study                  | 4-5 hours        |
| 3D Study                  | 5-7 hours        |
| Photo Documentation       | 1 hour           |
| Writing                   | 2 hours          |
| Case Study Implementation | 1-6 hours        |


### Assignment Styles

Design assignments can take many forms. Sometimes what you need to do will be explicity spelled out. More often, you will often encounter open problems, assignments, and briefs and will need to figure out what to do yourself.


| Style               | Focus           |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Step-by-Step        | What to do      |
| Specifications      | What to make    |
| Problem Description | What to solve   |
| Theme               | What to explore |
| Open                | When it's due   |


- Self-initiated research
- Grant Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
- Clients often don't know what they need. 
- Clients often think they need something they don't.
- Product and business development
- Your Thesis
