Join your assigned group. Score your partner's assignment by answering each question below, awarding the listed number of points for completed tasks.

Go to the [assignment matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OVtofA8TV2qSv_RnN7W7BAem_cFSkqaAivjmNusbYWU/edit).

- `1 point` Did your teammate post a link to the matrix?
- `1 point` Does the link lead to their stub page?
- `1 point` Does the stub page include their name?
- `1 point` Does the stub page display an image?

Open the stub page repo on github. You can find the repo based on the stub page URL:

`https://abjoines.github.io/Systems/` -> `https://github.com/abjoines/Systems`

Find the source for the stub page.

- `1 point` Is the source in the `/docs` folder?
- `1 point` Is the source written using `.html` (not `.md`)?

Remember the total score.
