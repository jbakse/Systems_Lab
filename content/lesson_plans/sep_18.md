## Design Responsibility
Every design decision has an impact on the whole. Some decisions have a minor impact and some have a major impact, but the importance of a design decision does not depend on the effort spent by the designer in making it. It is easy to spend a great deal of time on an unimportant decision. It is easy overlook something critical, trusting to convention, defaults, or the status quo.

As a designer you can't avoid the impact of design decision by leaving it unmade.

<div class="biggest">

You can't avoid communicating.

Each design decision *you make* communicates.

Each design decision *you don't make* communicates.

Watch out for defaults.
