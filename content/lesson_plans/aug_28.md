## Design + Technology Introduction

### Design

Design is a methodical method of problem solving. It is a set of tools for identifying and understanding problems; proposing and testing solutions; and arriving—reliably—with an **expression** of **purpose**.

Design is the principle skill of the designer, and can be applied to challenges in all fields.

### Technology

A technology is anything we create that extends our human capability. 

**Roads** allow us to travel faster and farther.
**Language** allows us to share our ideas faster and farther.
**Computing** allows us to **think** faster and farther. 

This isn't just a convenience or shortcut. Computation is the most important technology yet developed. Computation allows us to travel to new territories of thoughts, explore higher complexities, and reach ideas that before would have been out of reach.

Computation is a principle tool of the design technologist, and can be applied to challenges in all fields.

### Design + Technology is Important

Design Technologists use the skills and tools of design to play a critical role in guiding the impact technology has on our lives and our world. Technology is in great need of this guidance. Technology is too important and too powerful to let happen without design.

Technologies are not neutral. The technologies we have access to and the way they are designed has an defining impact on how we approach problems, what we create, and how we lead our lives.

As the **designers** of technology we have a responsibility to consider the impact of our work broadly and to design according to our values:

- What are the biases in the technologies we create?
- What approaches do they encourage?
- What solutions do they suggest?
- What is the **impact we want** and what should we **make** to **achieve that impact**?

### The Double-All-Nighter
Many projects start with a good idea and end in a double-all-nighter with little work done in-between. Working this way can be fun and exciting when it leads to good results. Especially on smaller projects, where luck and raw, undisciplined talent is enough to scrape by, double-all-nighters work. But this is not a reliable way to work. This approach is stressful when things go wrong, frustrating when things fall apart, and tedious when you loose faith in the idea but must slog on anyway. Working this way makes it hard to forecast which project ideas will work and difficult to steer a project that is veering of course.

### Developing a Personal Process
The double-all-nighter habit can be difficult to break. It can be frustrating to switch to a more methodical process-oriented design approach. Process-oriented design can feel slow, mechanical, formulaic. It may feel like you are setting your talent, creativity, and good-ideas aside. At times it may feel like you would do better if you went back to a good-idea-and–double-all-nighter approach.

 In truth, all of this may even be true, at first. In time, through practice, your ability to use process-oriented design methods as tools will improve and they will begin to support your talents and allow you to create larger, more complicated projects with better results. You will find that your talent takes you further, your creativity deepens, and your ideas are better. When you have developed a personal, process-oriented approach to design, you will have a set of tools needed to reliably produce successful projects.

### Syllabus

The full [syllabus can be found here](../syllabus.html). Here are the highlights:

- The primary goal of Systems Lab is to present design as a method of inquiry with a focus on process-oriented design, design research methods, and creative studio practice.

- Primary Assignments: 5 in 5, Ideas in Form, Instruction Sets for Strangers, Technical Challenge, Final Project

- Students will post course work—including reading responses, writing assignments, project prototypes, work in progress, and final documentation—to their own website.

- The focus of this class is on design process not final results.

- Daily materials: laptop + sketchbook + black pen + red pen + pencil

- Attendance policy in short: **Attend every class, get there early, stay late.**

- Every time you include **anything** in your work that you didn't make, **clearly credit** the source.
