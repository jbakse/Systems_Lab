## Primary Research vs Secondary Research

Research is a critical part of the design process. One could describe design as [balancing competing goals and constraints](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X). Research is the process of discovering, understanding, developing, and forming those goals and constraints. 

Designers make heavy use of both primary and secondary research throughout the design process, from ideation to delivery.


| Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Research**   | Learning from direct action, making, and primary sources <br/> Generating new knowledge <br/>*Sketching, Prototyping, Experimenting, Interviewing, Surveying* |
| **Secondary Research** | Learning from research of others <br/> Collecting existing knowledge <br/> *Reading Reports, Journals, Books, Periodicals*                                    |



## Supporting your Design with Secondary Research

Secondary research is an important tool for designers:
1. It is common for questions to naturally emerge in the course of creative projects.
2. Ideas for creative projects often emerge from insights gleaned from research.

- My project is about X. What is X?
- Is there anything interesting to say about X?
- What do I think about X?
- What do other people think about X?
- Has anyone done work about X before?
- Will people understand what I'm doing?
- Does anyone actually want this?
<!-- - How do I get this to work?
- How much will it cost to make? -->

Research is an *necessary tool* for designers who wish to make designs founded on *understanding*.


### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources

Secondary research is collecting and learning from the research of others. There are three main types of sources to consult in secondary research.

| Type                 | Description                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Source**   | Original Artifacts, Firsthand Reports <br/> *original artwork, speeches, photographs, correspondence, research journals* |
| **Secondary Source** | Analysis + Discussion of Evidence <br/> *books, articles, reviews, commentaries*                                         |
| **Tertiary Source**  | Introductory Overview of Topic <br/> *encyclopedias, bibliographies, textbooks*                                          |

## Assignment Introduction: Ideas in Form 

Review [Ideas in Form](../assignment_ideas.html) assignment.

## Focusing your Research

::: .callout
Today is just practice to introduce these tools, you should use these tools as you work through this—and every—project.

**These are tools, not steps.**

Research usually does not and should not proceed linearly from question to answer. Research should lead to both answers and new questions. The question you end up answering is often different—and better—than the one you started with.
/::

### Tool 1: 10 Minute Expert
The internet is an absolutely incredible tool for quickly exploring a new idea. By spending a couple of hours actively investigating an idea on the internet you can gain suprising useful—if shallow—understanding of most topics. While this level of investation clearly won't make you an expert, it will give you a much better understanding of the key issues at play, putting you in a much better position to begin more in-depth research.

I suggest a split-search-skim-repeat method.

For example, imagine you are taking a class on making games with the game engine Unity.

1. **Split** Break your concept into related ideas: 
  *game design, game development, Unity, game programming, game engines, your teacher*

2. **Search** Look for websites, articles, video, and images for each topic.

3. **Skim** Quickly review each resource. If a resource looks good, note its url and make a small note about its value. You'll come back to the best things later.

4. **Repeat** After the first round, you'll uncover more search terms: *C#, MonoDevelop, Game Theory, Unreal, Pico-8, tutorials, game jams*

After an hour+ looking for reasources and an hour+ reading the most interesting ones, you'll be much more warmed-up and much better prepared to begin more in-depth research.

### Tool 2: Concept Mapping

In the beginning states of rearch, it is common for researches to shift and narrow their topic as they begin to understand the underlying issues better and find what interests them most.

Concept mapping can be used to explore a constellation of ideas and look for **specific, interesting, researchable relationships**.


For example, a researcher studying "self-driving cars" may find that their core interest is actually "how designers make life-and-death decisions". They would then shift their research efforts in that direction, keeping "self-driving cars" as a key example.

::: .callout
*Individual, 10 minutes*
1. Begin with a clean sheet of paper.
2. Choose a topic you are interested in developing a project around.
3. Write down your topic and the primary domains associated with your topic in spaced out bubbles.
4. Brainstorm concepts suggested by each bubble, adding them to your map.
5. Let your map grow in a freeform way. Don't worry about how your map "should" look.
6. Connect related concepts. Look for interesting **overlaps**, **contrasts**, and **tensions**; mark them on your map.
7. Write down research topics suggested by these relationships.
/::

### Tool 3: Topic Scoping

It is important to consider the scope of your research topic early. Inexperienced researches tend to pick overly broad research topics.

**Broad** topics are easier to find sources for, harder to cover, and **boring**.

**Focused** topics are harder to find sources for, easier to cover, and **interesting**.

| Broad                              | Focused                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The history of commercial aviation | The contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation (example from *Booth*) |
| K-pop                              | How the depiction of sexuality differs between K-pop and western pop music videos                                        |
| North American Cacti               | Uses of cactus needles in North American indigenous cultures.                                                            |

Taking time to consider how you might expand and narrow your topic can help you find an appropriately scoped topic.


| Scope          | Topic                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Super Broad    | The complete history of music                                                              |
| Broad          | Japanese culture                                                                           |
| Moderate       | K-pop idols                                                                                |
| Specific       | How the depiction of sexuality differs in K-pop and western pop music videos               |
| Super Specific | How visual references to Satanism are used in BABYMETAL's *Doki Doki Morning* music video. |


::: .callout
*Individual, 10 minutes*
1. Begin with a clean sheet of paper.
2. Choose a topic suggested by your domain mapping exercise, write that topic in the middle of your paper.
3. At the top of the page write a very broad phrasing of your topic.
4. At the bottom of the page write a very narrowly focused version of your topic.
5. Add a middle-broad topic.
6. Add a middle-focused topic.

### Tool 4: A Research Statement

In research, "Why am I researching?", "What am I researching?", and "What do I need to learn?" are related but distinct questions. Composing a research statement can help you clarify the relationship between these three questions and help you answer them.

Creating a well written research statement will help you:
- Clarify what you are researching and why.
- Quickly communicate the scope and purpose of your research to others.

The following template is a helpful guide for forming an effective research statement.


::: .callout
<div class="template">
I am studying <span class="blank">1</span>____________<br/>
because I want to find out <span class="blank">2</span>____________<br/>
to support making <span class="blank">3</span>____________<br/>
</div>

<style>
.template {
    font-size: 2em;
   line-height: 1.5;
}
.blank {
    font-size: .5em;
    padding: .5em;
    color: gray;
}
</style>

#### 1. State a subject area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. State what you do not know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. State what you are making.
/::

> I am studying *self driving cars* because I want to find out *how their designers encode live-and-death decisions* to support making *a simulator exploring AI ethics*.

> I am studying *the role of military in developing the DC-3* because I want to find out *how military spending impacts private sector growth* to support writing *a grant proposal that will depend on military funding*.

> I am studying *bryant park* because I want to find out *how people move through the space* to support making *a public-art installation*.




## Presenting your Findings
You will present your findings with a 4 minute slide presentation.

### 0. Plan
Presenting in a short time requires planning and practice. Take the time to identify the most important information and rehearse to make sure you have time to present everything you plan to.

Almost all of your information should be conveyed by what you say, use slides sparingly to support what you say.

Don't put any text on your slides you don't expect us to read. Make sure you give us enough quiet time to read it.


### 1. Hook 'em
Before you get to the primary point, give us a reason to be interested.

A personal, relatable anecdote or a specific, thought-provoking question is often an effective opener.

### 2. Tell 'em What You'll Tell 'em
Briefly tell us what your presentation is about, and what we will know at the end. This helps us organize the information in our heads as you deliver it. For this presentation, you might do this using the research statement template. In a presentation about your project, you might show your finished project first.

::: .callout
Don't wander up to your point. Start with the most interesting thing you learned through your research and then elaborate. Start with what you made, and then tell us about it.
/::

### 3. Tell 'em
Convey your research findings. Specifically connect everything you tell us to the larger context and your main point.

### 4. Tell 'em what you told 'em
Bring your presentation to a clear conclusion.

::: .callout
A good way to bring your project to a conclusion is a single, clear scentence that connects a key finding and a possible future action.

> The depiction of male sex appeal in K-Pop music videos is different from that in western music videos, and I'd like to explore what influences led to that difference in further research.

## Homework

Due Tuesday:
- Your Ideas in Form project page with the Part 1 deliverables
- Your Ideas in Form research report.
- Your 5 in 5 Case Study page.

Setting Homework Expectations:
- As a general rule of thumb college students should work **2 to 3 hours outside of class for every hour in class**. [1](https://www.collegeparentcentral.com/2010/02/is-your-college-student-investing-enough-time-studying/), [2](https://classroom.synonym.com/average-college-time-put-homework-vs-high-school-2133.html)
- This works out to **45 to 72 hours a week** for a fulltime DT Student: 15-18 hours in class, 30 to 54 hours outside of class.
- Systems Lab is one of your core DT clases, and you should expect to spend **10 to 15 hours on your Lab Projects**.
- Studio programs and classes are generally *more* demanding than lectures. Learning skills takes more time than learning knowledge.
