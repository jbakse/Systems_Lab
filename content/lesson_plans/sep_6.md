### Background Research
Quote can be about design research:
How do you find out what you are walling in and out, how do you learn about the audience/"something there":

> Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
> What I was walling in or walling out,
> And to whom I was like to give offence.
> Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
> That wants it down.
