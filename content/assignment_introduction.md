# Assignment 0: Studio Introduction

Most of this class will be run like a design studio. Your fellow classmates will be one of your most important resources this semester, and you will be one of theirs. It is important that we get to know about one another.

For this assignment, be ready to introduce yourself through a short presentation at the beginning of the first day of class. 

### Objectives
- Tell us your name.
- Teach us one thing that you know and that we probably don’t.
- Be clear.
- Be memorable.

### Constraints
- You may not use more than two minutes, but you may use less.
- You may not use the classroom AV equipment.

### Deliverables
- Your only deliverable for this assignment is to give your presentation in class. 

### Tips
- This is your first project for Systems Lab and will be your first impression on the class. Put some time in to prepare.
- We will vote on which studio introduction is: clearest, most memorable, funniest, friendliest, most beautiful, most entertaining, least predictable, most efficient, best conceived, best executed.
- Don’t worry about doing this “right”. If you are not sure what to do, just guess. 

### Why are we Doing this Assignment?
- We need to hit the ground running. We have a lot to cover this semester, let’s get started.
- These introductions will be important prerequisite for our first in-class workshop.
