# Assignment 2: Ideas in Form

Designers combine many methods of research to *both gather existing information* and *explore new ideas through making*. This assigment focuses on design studies—small, focused pieces created in the research phase of design projects. Designers use studies to look for interesting connections between formal elements (expression) and research topics (content).

### Objective

1. Research a chosen topic and create a series of studies exploring that topic in different mediums.

2. Create and maintain a webpage documenting your process and results.

# Part 1: Background Research

[[ primary/secondary research, primary/secondary sources]]
[[ scope narrowing workshop]]
[[ marrisa ]]
[[google scholar]

In pairs, choose a narrow topic of shared interest to research. Present your topic to the class.

10 Minute Expert
Identify 5 to 8 domains or subjects related to your research topic.
Find 2 to 3 high-quality web resources (articles, websites, videos) for each.
Write a 1 sentence overview describing the value of each resource.
Add an organized directory of links to your project page.

At this point, you may wish to *reframe* or *narrow* your research topic, but don't *change* it.

Secondary Research
Explore the physical and online New School libraries.

[[GET THOUGHTS ON THIS FROM LEAH]]
- Find and study **two secondary sources**.
- Find and study **two primary sources**.
- For each of these write a ~100 word summary focusing on key information related to your research topic.
- Add your summaries to your project page using the [Chicago](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/DocChicago.html) style for your individual citations.
- Add a link to the assignment matrix.

At this point, you may wish to *reframe* or *narrow* your research topic, but don't *change* it.


Presentation Constraints
Your presentation should be exactly 4 minutes long.
Both team members should present with roughly equal speaking-time.
Specifically mention each of your primary and secondary sources by name and at least one finding from each.
Your presentation should be supported by slides.
Use exactly 8 slides.
Prefer images to text on your slides.
No more than 8 words on a slide.

Considerations
Is your topic appropriately scoped and interesting?
Did you present research findings that illuminate your topic?
Was your presentation clearly organized and delivered?
Did your slides effectively support your presentation?

Part 2: 2D

Working individually, create a 2D study exploring your area of research. Be prepared to informally present and discuss your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

2D Constraints
This study should be static 2D. No depth, no time, no interaction.
Your study should be physical, print-outs are okay.
Any physical 2D format is allowed including posters, drawings, and photographs.
Your study should be pinned up in the classroom before the start of class.

[[ science fair presentation, with focused questions to answer and present to class (to bring some emphasis to reflection). “What did you learn from this!?” Exploring now, but want to be able to cite the things you’ve made to support future decisions]]
Part 3: 3D
Working individually, create a 3D study exploring your area of research.  Be prepared to informally present and discuss your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

3D Constraints
This study should be static 3D. No interaction.
Your study should be physical.
Any physical 3D media is allowed including wood, metal, clay, and cardboard.
Your study should be placed on a table in the classroom before the start of class.
Part 4: Interactive
Working individually, create a interactive study exploring your area of research.  Be prepared to informally present and discuss your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

3D Constraints
This study should allow some form of user interaction.
Use the “Wizard-of-Oz” protocol to realize this study
Any physical media is allowed including wood, legos, paper, and cardboard.
Your study should be placed on a table in the classroom before the start of class.
