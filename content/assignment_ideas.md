# Assignment 2: Ideas in Form

Designers combine many methods of research to *both gather existing information* and *explore new ideas through making*. This assigment focuses on design studies—small, focused pieces created in the research phase of design projects. Designers use studies to look for interesting connections between formal elements (expression) and research topics (content).

### Objective

1. Research a chosen topic and create a series of studies exploring that topic in different mediums.

2. Create and maintain a webpage documenting your process and results.

# Part 1: Background Research

In pairs, choose a narrow topic of shared interest to research. Present your topic to the class.

### 10 Minute Expert
1. Identify 5 to 8 aspects of your research topic.
2. Find 2 to 3 high-quality web resources (articles, websites, videos) for each.
2. Write a 1 sentence overview describing *the value* of each resource.
3. Add an organized directory of links to your project page.

At this point, you may wish to *reframe* or *narrow* your research topic, but don't *change* it.

### Secondary Research
Explore the physical and online New School libraries.
1. Find and study **two secondary sources**.
2. Find and study **two primary sources**.
3. For each of these write a ~100 word summary focusing on key information related to your research topic.
4. Add your summaries to your project page using the [Chicago](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/DocChicago.html) style for your individual citations.

At this point, you may wish to *reframe* or *narrow* your research topic, but don't *change* it.

### Presentation Constraints
- Your presentation should be exactly 4 minutes long.
- Both team members should present with roughly equal speaking-time.
- Specifically mention each of your primary and secondary sources by name and at least one finding from each.
- Your presentation should be supported by slides.
- Use exactly 8 slides.
- Prefer images to text on your slides.
- No more than 8 words on a slide.

### Considerations
- Is your topic appropriately scoped and interesting?
- Do present research findings that illuminate your topic?
- Is your presentation clearly organized and delivered?
- Do your slides effectively support your presentation?


### Deliverables
- Begin a single webpage to document your Ideas in Form project. It should contain the research links described above, and you will add to it throughout this project.
- Create your presentation deck using Google slides.
- Post links to your webpage and deck to the assignment matrix.



# Part 2: 2D

Working individually, create a 2D study exploring your area of research. Be prepared to informally present and discuss your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

### 2D Constraints
- This study should be static 2D. No depth, no time, no interaction.
- Your study should be physical, print-outs are okay.
- Any physical 2D format is allowed including posters, drawings, and photographs.


### Deliverables
- Your physical 2D study, pinned up in the classroom before the start of class.
- Add photo documenation of your study to your project page.
- Add at least 200 words discussing your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.


# Part 3: 3D
Working individually, create a 3D study exploring your area of research.  Be prepared to informally present and discuss your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

### 3D Constraints
- This study should be static 3D. No interaction.
- Your study should be physical.
- Any physical 3D media is allowed including wood, metal, clay, and cardboard.

### Deliverables
- Your physical 3D study, placed on a table in the classroom before the start of class.
- Add photo documenation of your study to your project page.
- Add at least 200 words discussing your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

# Part 4: Interactive
Working individually, create a interactive study exploring your area of research.  Be prepared to informally present and discuss your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.

### Interactive Constraints
- Some form of user interaction should be central to this study.
- Use the “Wizard-of-Oz” protocol to realize this study
- Any physical media is allowed including wood, legos, paper, and cardboard.

### Deliverables
- Your physical 3D study, placed on a table in the classroom before the start of class. 
- Add photo documenation of your study to your project page.
- Add a video demonstrating your study in use to your project page.
- Add at least 200 words discussing your study, how it relates to your research topic, and what you learned from making it.
